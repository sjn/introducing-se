## Inspiration

Further inspiration for the content on this site has been gathered from the [Street Epistemology Basics](https://streetepistemology.com/blog/street-epistemology-the-basics) page on streetepistemology.com, and from practicing and observing SE conversations on the SE Discord server and with strangers.
