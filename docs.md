#### What is Epistemology?

The field of Philosophy focusing on *how* we know what we know.

<br>

* *«How do we know if some&shy;thing is true?»*
* *«Which methods and tools can we employ to determine this?»*

\
With SE we try to bring this out of academia and into everyday life.

#### Patience & practice

*Keeping a frien&shy;dly tone is critical for success*.

<br>

* *Be patient* – You may need to have a few «soft» chats before pro&shy;ce&shy;eding with a con&shy;ten&shy;tious topic.
* *Don't offer facts* (also cal&shy;led «topic re&shy;but&shy;tal»), un&shy;less asked.
* *Stay cool* – Avoiding *topic rebut&shy;tal* may re&shy;quire practice!
* *Practice* – [SE may at first be easier with strangers](#/8).

\
Swipe [↓](#/1/3) [→](#/2)


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Adopt a learner's attitude

* Be **Self-directed** – ask about what you find curious or confusing.
* … **Open-minded** – there's always something to learn!
* … **Single-minded** – focus on one topic until you grasp it.
* and **Thorough** – don't just acknowledge, but try to *connect* ideas.

\
*«I want to understand in order to explore.»*

#### Ask, don't tell

* ✅ *«Can you help me under&shy;stand what you mean with…»*
* ✅ *«Do I understand you correctly…»*
* ✅ *«How do I explain to someone else…»*
* ❌ *«Don't you think that…»*
* ❌ *«Are you saying that…»*
* ❌ *«How do you justify…»*

### 2. Find & clarify claim

* *«Do you have a claim you want to explore?»*
* *«... a topic you wish more people knew of?»*
* *«Would you mind if we explored this claim together?»*
* Aim or a **single topic**.
* Phrase the topic in the form of a claim.
* Ask if it's a good claim to explore together.

\
*Don't rush when considering claims!*


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

#### Clarifying terms

*«True»* vs. *«True for me»* vs. *«True for all.»*

<br>

* *«What do you mean when you say …?»*
* In your own words, **repeat** what you hear.
* Have them **confirm** if you under&shy;stand correctly.
* Identify, clarify & qualify confusing words.
* Use *their* de&shy;fini&shy;tions.

\
*Take notes!*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Good & bad claims

* ✅ Claim is specific & clear.
* ✅ …Foundational or im&shy;portant.
* ✅ *«I believe …»*
* ❌ *«I don't believe …»*
* ⚠️  …Trivial or obvious.
* ⚠️  Stop if the claim supports a [Safety Net](#/2/3)!


[comment]: # (|||)

#### ⚠️  Stopping early

A *Safety Net* is a belief that pre&shy;vents an individual from doing harm to them&shy;selves or others.

\
*«My Belief helped me be&shy;come sober, and without it I would probably drink myself to death.»*

\
SE is not always the right tool to use, and **SE is not for therapy**. Please do no harm!

### 3. Ask for & calibrate scaled confidence

* *«How **confident** are you X is true?»* 0–100%
* *«What would move you up just a bit?»*
* *«What would move you down?»*
* *«What could change your mind?»*


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

#### Exploring confidence

* At 100%, *«Would any&shy;thing increase your con&shy;fidence even higher?»*
* *«How would physical evidence change your con&shy;fidence?»*
* At 0%, *«What reasons do you think others have for being higher?»*
* Above 0%, *«Why not lower?»*
* Below 100%, *«Why not higher?»*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Pre-contemplative —&nbsp;or&nbsp;not?

* 100% or 0% con&shy;fidence may indicate they are pre-&shy;con&shy;tem&shy;pla&shy;tive.
* Maybe explore a «softer» topic first?
* …Or ask them if they'd like to re&shy;cali&shy;brate their con&shy;fidence!

\
*«If there is still room to be&shy;come more con&shy;fi&shy;dent, what would you re&shy;cali&shy;brate your cur&shy;rent con&shy;fi&shy;dence to?»*


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 4. Identify main reason

* **What reasons** and methods did they use to arrive at their belief?
* Assess the reliability of these reasons.
* What methods were used to determine a reason was sound?
* If these methods are un&shy;reli&shy;able, would the as&shy;sess&shy;ment change?


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

#### Exploring underlying reasons

* *«If this reason was un&shy;avail&shy;able to you, would it change your con&shy;fi&shy;dence?»*
* *«…if so, how would it change?»*
* *«…and if not, **what else** is keeping you at your confidence level?»*
* [Switching topic](#/2) or focusing on [another reason](#/4) is fine!

\
*«Claim 2 seems to be important for your belief in claim 1. Would you mind if we explore it instead?»*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Many small, or a&nbsp;few&nbsp;large

* *A thousand small rea&shy;sons, or a few big ones*? — explore to under&shy;stand the back&shy;ground of the claim.
* With many small, ask how each in&shy;flu&shy;en&shy;ces their confidence.
* Is this influence ad&shy;ditive (& may surpass 100%) or mul&shy;tipli&shy;ca&shy;tive (& may never reach 100%)?
* Let them re&shy;cali&shy;brate their con&shy;fi&shy;dence as you explore.

\
*When you're done, restate & sum&shy;marize their reason(s).*


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 5. Explore & assess reliablility

Is our epistemology reliable? Let's assess.

<br>

* *«How did you arrive at the reason?»*
* *«Was a method used to determine the reason was sound?»*
* *«How can we de&shy;termine if this method is reliable?»*

\
*«If a method or a reason is un&shy;reli&shy;able, how does this affect our as&shy;sess&shy;ment?»*


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

#### The key goal of SE

* Explore the reliability of methods used when forming a belief.
* *How* questions are bet&shy;ter than *Why* & *What.*
* Embrace their pauses, allow them to think!
* *«Let's go through the steps together.»*
* *«How can we be con&shy;fident if our methods aren't reliable?»*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Explore reliability I

**The outsider test**
–&nbsp;*«Would some&shy;one using your rea&shy;sons, but coming from a different starting point reach the same conclusion?»*

**The consultant test**
–&nbsp;*«How would you evaluate this claim if it was **not** your own?»*

**The double standard test**
–&nbsp;*«Am I judging other people’s reasoning by a standard I wouldn’t apply to myself?»*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Explore reliability II

**The conformity test**
–&nbsp;*«If other people no longer held this belief, to what extent would you still hold it?»*

**The status quo bias test**
–&nbsp;*«If your current claim was not the status quo, would you still actively choose it?»*

**The selective skeptic test**
–&nbsp;*«If the same reasoning supported a different or opposing conclusion, how credible would you judge it to be?»*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Recognizing unreliable reasons

* ❌ [Informal fallacies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Informal_fallacies), like *Appeals to auth&shy;ority*, *ig&shy;no&shy;rance* or *tradition.*
* ❌ [Cognitive biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias#List_of_biases), like *Con&shy;fir&shy;mation bias*, *Av&shy;ail&shy;abi&shy;lity heu&shy;ris&shy;tic* and *Moti&shy;vated reasoning.*
* ❌ Sources don't pass [the C.R.A.A.P. test](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAAP_test).

\
*«If a text only offers thoughts I agree with, how can I know it is truthful?»*

### 6. End on a high note, with a good question

* The best endings offer food for thought!
* Try to end on a posi&shy;tive note, with *wonder* or *[aporia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aporia)*.
* Success? – You have it when **both are happy** to have had the con&shy;ver&shy;sation.
* If you can, offer to con&shy;tinue the chat later.
* Maybe give them a printed [Introducing.SE card](dist/media/introducing-se-card-2022-01.pdf)?

#### A reason to return

Some conversations may re&shy;quire several sessions. Give them reasons to look forward to them!

\
*«That was a good ques&shy;tion. You're making me think!»*


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 7. But first, consider…

*Before engaging in SE, ask your&shy;self some questions.*

<br>

* What's your goal? To learn, em&shy;path&shy;ize or help them change their mind?
* Are you open to learn and change your own mind too?
* What is it you *really* want to achieve?
* As you proceed, expect your goals and intentions to show.
* Share your intentions upfront!


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

#### Personal preparations

* Expect them to dislike *scripted* conversations.
* …or «interviewing».
* …or leading questions.
* …or overt «messaging».
* …or being em&shy;barrassed.
* …or made to feel cornered.

\
*— Listen actively and without pre&shy;sump&shy;tion.*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Practical preparations

*Depending on your situation, you may also want to…*

<br>

* Bring something to take notes with.
* Bring a friend! Let them listen in, without par&shy;ti&shy;ci&shy;pation.
* Optionally, bring an audio recorder for your own use or for sharing.
* Optionally, bring a timer.


[comment]: # (!!!)
