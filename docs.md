#### What is Street Epistemology (SE)?

* A way to help us have bet&shy;ter talks about hard topics.
* A conversatio&shy;nal tool&shy;box for explo&shy;ring ideas and beliefs.
* A step towards lear&shy;ning col&shy;laborative thinking.
* A community that prac&shy;tices SE in a frien&shy;dly environment.

#### What is Epistemology?

The field of Philosophy focusing on *how* we know what we know.

<br>

* *«How do we know if something is true?»*
* *«Which methods and tools can we employ to determine this?»*

\
With SE we try to bring this out of academia and into everyday life.


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 1. Come prepared

* Be honest about your intentions upfront.
* Do you want to learn, teach or empathize?
* Are you also open to changing your own mind?
* Explain and [share](#/8) this method!
* Recording? **Ask for consent**.

\
Bring something to take notes with!

#### Expect from yourself

* Explore *how* they know what they know.
* When in doubt, focus on *tech&shy;nique* instead of *topic*.
* Listen without presumption.
* Avoid *only* using this guide. There's more to learn!


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Expect from them

* They dislike *scripted* conversations.
* … or «interviewing».
* … or being embarrassed.
* … or made to feel cornered.
* Triumphing & *gotcha* moments are coun&shy;ter&shy;productive!


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 2. Build rapport

* Establish a **friendly tone** & maintain it.
* Show you're inter&shy;ested & listening.
* Share what You have in common.
* Show curiosity.


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

#### Patience & practice

*Keeping a frien&shy;dly tone is critical for success*.

<br>

* *Be patient* – It's fine to have seve&shy;ral chats before pro&shy;ce&shy;eding with hard topics.
* *Don't offer facts* – Unless asked.
* *Stay cool* – Avoiding *topic rebut&shy;tal* (offering facts) may require practice!
* *Improve* – [Practice SE with strangers](#/8/1).


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 3. Find & confirm a claim

* *«Do you have a claim you want to explore?»*
* Find or suggest a **single topic**.
* Phrase the topic in the form of a claim.
* Ask if it's a good claim to explore together.
* *Don't rush when considering claims.*

\
Take notes!


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

#### Good & bad claims

* ✅ Claim is specific & clear.
* ✅ … Foundational or im&shy;portant.
* ✅ *«I believe …»*
* ❌ *«I don't believe …»*
* ⚠️  … Trivial or obvious.
* ⚠️  Stop if the claim is a [Safety Net](#/3/2) belief!


[comment]: # (|||)

#### When to abort early

*Safety Net*, in this context, is something that pre&shy;vents an individual from doing harm to them&shy;selves or others.

\
*«My Belief helped me be&shy;come sober, and without it I would probably drink myself to death.»*

\
SE is **not always** the right tool to use!


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 4. Clarify terms

* *«What do you mean when you say …?»*
* In your own words, **repeat** what you hear.
* **Confirm** if you under&shy;stand correctly.
* Identify, clarify & qualify words that may confuse.

\
Take notes!

#### Politeness & clarity

Adopt a learner's per&shy;spective – *«I want to understand.»*

\
Use *their* de&shy;fini&shy;tions.

\
Qualify terms – *«True»* vs. *«True for me»* vs. *«True for all.»*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Learner's perspective

* ✅ *«Can you help me under&shy;stand what you mean with …»*
* ✅ *«Do I understand you correctly …»*
* ✅ *«How do I explain to someone else …»*
* ❌ *«Don't you think that …»
* ❌ *«Are you saying that …»*
* ❌ *«How do you justify …»*

\
*«Be the open mind you want to encounter!»*


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 5. Assess & calibrate confidence

* *«How **confident** are you … is true?»* 0–100%
* *«What would move you up just a bit?»*
* *«What would move you down?»*
* *«What could change your mind?»*


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

* At 100%, *«Would any&shy;thing increase your con&shy;fidence even higher?»*
* *«How would physical evidence change your con&shy;fidence?»*
* At 0%, *«What reasons do you think others have for being higher?»*
* Above 0%, *«Why not lower?»*
* Below 100%, *«Why not higher?»*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Finding underlying claims

* *«If this reason was un&shy;avail&shy;able to you, would it change your con&shy;fi&shy;dence level?»*
* *«… and **if not, what else** is keeping you at your level?»*
* [Switching topic](#/3) is fine!

\
*«Claim 2 seems to be important for your belief in claim 1. Would you mind if we explore it instead?»*


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 6. Explore reasons & reliability

* **What reasons** did they use to arrive at their belief?
* Assess the quality of these reasons.
* What can we do to de&shy;termine a reason is sound?
* If our methods are un&shy;reli&shy;able, would the as&shy;sess&shy;ment change?


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

*This is the key goal of Street&nbsp;Epistemology.*

<br>

* Explore the reliability of methods used when forming a belief.
* *How* questions are bet&shy;ter than *Why* & *What.*
* Embrace their pauses.
* *«Let's go through the steps together.»*
* *«How can we be con&shy;fident if our methods aren't reliable?»*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Recognizing bad reasons

* ❌ [Informal fallacies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Informal_fallacies), like *Appeals to auth&shy;ority*, *ig&shy;no&shy;rance* or *tradition.*
* ❌ [Cognitive biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias#List_of_biases), like *Con&shy;fir&shy;mation bias*, *Av&shy;ail&shy;abi&shy;lity heu&shy;ris&shy;tic* and *Moti&shy;vated reasoning.*
* ❌ Sources don't pass [the C.R.A.A.P. test](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAAP_test).

\
*«If a text only offers thoughts I agree with, how can I know it is truthful?»*


[comment]: # (|||)

#### Explore reasoning

**The outsider test** – *«Would some&shy;one else with your rea&shy;sons, but one core dif&shy;fer&shy;ence, reach the same conclusion?»*


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 7. Summarize & pause to think

* Try to end with *wonder* or *aporia*.
* Success is when **both are happy** to have had the conversation.
* If you can, offer to con&shy;tinue the chat later.
* Give them a printed [Introducing.SE card](dist/media/introducing-se-card-2021-01.pdf)!

#### Reason to return

Some conversations may re&shy;quire several sessions.

\
End your sessions with some&shy;thing they can wonder about!

\
*«That was a good ques&shy;tion. You're making me think!»*
