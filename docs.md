### 1. Set your goals

* Do you want to learn, teach or empathize?
* Are you also open to changing your own mind?
* Be honest about your intentions upfront
* [Share](#/8) the process & this page

Many people are uncomfortable with conversations
that seem *scripted*.

\
A good way to avoid this is this is to focus on
*technique rebuttal* instead of *topic rebuttal*
— unless you are an expert in the topic at hand!

### 2. Build rapport

* Find a friendly tone & maintain it
* Show that you are interested & listening
* Share what you have in common
* Show curiosity
* Don't offer facts unless asked

Keeping a conversation friendly is critical for success.
Be patient – and if needed, allow several chats before proceeding.

\
Practicing SE with strangers helps a lot!

### 3. Find & confirm a claim

* ✅ Claims that are specific & clear
* ✅ Claims that are foundational
* ❌ Is the claim «obvious»?
* Ask if they want to explore it with you
* ⚠️  Stop if the claim is a «safety net»!

In this context, a «safty net» is something
that prevents an individual from doing harm
to themselves or others

\
– *«Jesus helped me become sober, and without Him I would probably drink myself to death»*

### 4. Clarify terms

* «What do you mean when you say X?»
* In your own words, repeat what you hear
* Ask if you understand correctly
* Identify & clarify words that may confuse

### 5. ID confidence

* «How confident are you your claim is true?» 0–100%
* «What would move you up just a bit?»
* «What would move you down?»
* «What could change your mind?»

[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

* At 100%, *«Would anything increase your confidence even higher?»*
* *«How would physical evidence change your confidence?»*
* At 0%, *«What reasons do you think others have for being higher?»*
* Above 0%, *«Why not lower?»*
* Below 100%, *«Why not higher?»*

### 6. Explore reasons & reliability

* What reasons did they use to arrive at their belief?
* Assess the quality of these reasons
* What ways can we use to determine a reason is sound?
* If our methods are unreliable, would the assessment change?

[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

*This is the key goal of Street Epistemology*.

<br>

* Explore the reliability of any methods used when forming a belief.
* How > Why > What
* *«Let's go through the steps together»*
* *«How can we be so confident if our methods are unreliable?»*

*«If a website only writes things I agree with, how can I know it always is truthful?»*

### 7. Summarize & pause to think

* Try to end with aporia — wonder
* Success: When all are happy to have had the conversation
* If you can, offer to continue the chat later
* Give them a printed [Introducing.SE card](dist/media/introducing-se-card-2021-01.pdf)

Some conversations require several sessions.

\
If you can leave one session on a good tone, then the
next one may become easier!
