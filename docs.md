* Are you open to changing your own mind?
* Don’t use clever questions to “trap”
* Be honest upfront
* [Share](#/8) the process & this page

### 3. Find & confirm a claim

* ✅ Claims that are specific & clear
* ✅ Claims that are foundational
* ❌ Is the claim «obvious»?
* Ask if they want to explore it with you
* ⚠️  Stop if the claim is a «safety net»!

### 4. Clarify terms

* «What do you mean when you say X?»
* Repeat what you hear
* Ask if you understand correctly
* Identify & clarify words that may confuse

### 5. ID confidence

* «How confident are you your claim is true?» 0–100%
* «What would move you up just a few %?»
* «What would move you down?»
* What could change their mind?

### 6. Explore reasons & reliability

* What reasons did they use to arrive at their belief?
* Assess their quality
* What methods can we use to determine a reason is sound?
* If this method is unreliable – would it change anything?
* What else is propping up their belief?

### 7. Summarize & pause to think

* Try to end with aporia —wonder
* Success: When everyone is happy to have had the conversation
* If you can, offer to continue the chat later
* Give them a printed [Introducing.SE card](dist/media/introducing-se-card-2021-01.pdf)
