### 1. Check your intentions

* Do you want to learn or to teach?
* Are you open to change your own mind?

* Share what you have in common
* Show curiosity!

### 3. Find & confirm a claim

* Good: Claims that are specific & clear
* Good: Claims that are foundational
* Bad: Does “everyone” agree?
* Ask if they want to explore with you!
* Stop if the claim is a “safety net”!

### 4. Clarify terms

* “What do you mean when you say X?”
* Repeat what you hear
* Ask if you understand correctly
* Identify & clarify words that may confuse

### 5. ID confidence

* “How confident are you that your claim is true?” 0–100%
* “What would move you up 1%?”
* “What would move you down?”
* What could change their mind?

### 6. Explore reasons & reliability

* If they learn their source is unreliable – would it change anything?
* What else is propping up their belief?

### 7. Summarize & pause to think

* Try to end with aporia – wonder
* Success: When all are happy to have had the conversation
* If you can, offer to continue the chat later
