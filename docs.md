### What is Street Epistemology?

* A conversational toolbox for exploring ideas and beliefs
* A step towards mastering collaborative thinking
* A community that practices SE in a friendly environment

### What is Epistemology?

The field of Philosophy focusing on *how* we know what we know

<br>

* *«How do we know if something is true?»*
* *«Which methods and tools can we employ to determine this?»*

\
With SE we try to bring this out of academia and onto "the streets"

### 1. Set your goals

* Do you want to learn, teach or empathize?
* Are you also open to changing your own mind?
* Be honest about your intentions upfront
* Maybe [share](#/8) this method too!

Many are wary of "scripted" conversations. Don't use
just these pages – there's more to learn

\
Unsure? Aim for *technique rebuttal* instead of *topic rebuttal*,
unless you're an actual expert

\
Unlike the Socratic Method, SE avoids *gotcha* moments.
Instead, aim for epistemological exploration

### 2. Build rapport

* Find a friendly tone & maintain it
* Show that you are interested & listening
* Share what You have in common
* Show curiosity
* Don't offer facts unless asked

[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

Keeping a conversation friendly is *critical* for it's success

\
*Be patient* – It's fine to build rapport over several chats before proceeding with the hardest topics

\
*Stay cool* – Avoiding *topic rebuttal* is hard, and often requires practice

\
*Unsure of something?* – [Practice SE with strangers](#/8/1)

### 3. Find & confirm a claim

* ✅ Claims that are specific & clear
* ✅ Claims that are foundational
* ❌ Is the claim «obvious»?
* Ask if they want to explore it with you
* ⚠️  Stop if the claim is a «safety net»!


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

In this context, a «safety net» is something
that prevents an individual from doing harm
to themselves or others

\
*«My God helped me become sober, and without Him I would probably drink myself to death»*

\
Sometimes SE isn't the right tool. Beware!

### 4. Clarify terms

* *«What do you mean when you say X?»*
* In your own words, repeat what you hear
* Ask if you understand correctly
* Identify & clarify words that may confuse


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

If it's difficult to *pin down* a term, then agree to use qualified terms instead

### 5. Assess & calibrate confidence

* *«How confident are you this claim is true?»* 0–100%
* *«What would move you up just a bit?»*
* *«What would move you down?»*
* *«What could change your mind?»*


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

* At 100%, *«Would anything increase your confidence even higher?»*
* *«How would physical evidence change your confidence?»*
* At 0%, *«What reasons do you think others have for being higher?»*
* Above 0%, *«Why not lower?»*
* Below 100%, *«Why not higher?»*

### 6. Explore reasons & reliability

* What reasons did they use to arrive at their belief?
* Assess the quality of these reasons
* What ways can we use to determine a reason is sound?
* If our methods are unreliable, would the assessment change?

[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

*This is the key goal of Street Epistemology*.

<br>

* Explore the reliability of any methods used when forming a belief.
* How > Why > What
* *«Let's go through the steps together»*
* *«How can we be confident if our methods aren't reliable?»*

*«If a website only writes things I agree with, how can I know it always is truthful?»*


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 7. Summarize & pause to think

* Try to end with aporia — wonder
* Success: When all are happy to have had the conversation
* If you can, offer to continue the chat later
* Give them a printed [Introducing.SE card](dist/media/introducing-se-card-2021-01.pdf)

Some conversations require several sessions

\
If you can leave one session on a good tone, then the
next one may become easier!
