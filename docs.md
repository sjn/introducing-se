### What is Street Epistemology?

* «SE» among friends, is...
* A way to help us have better talks about hard topics.
* A conversational tool&shy;box for exploring ideas and beliefs.
* A step towards mas&shy;tering col&shy;laborative thinking.
* A community that prac&shy;tices SE in a frien&shy;dly environment.

### What is Epistemology?

The field of Philosophy focusing on *how* we know what we know.

<br>

* *«How do we know if something is true?»*
* *«Which methods and tools can we employ to determine this?»*

\
With SE we try to bring this out of academia and into everyday life.

### 1. Set your goals

* Do you want to learn, teach or empathize?
* Are you also open to changing your own mind?
* Be honest about your intentions upfront.
* Maybe [share](#/8) this method too!

[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

#### Manage expectations

Many are wary of "scripted" con&shy;versations. Avoid *only*
using these pages. There's more to learn!

\
Unsure? Do *tech&shy;nique rebuttal* instead of *topic rebuttal*,
unless you're an actual expert.

\
Unlike the Socratic Method, with SE we avoid *gotcha* moments.
Instead, *ex&shy;plore epi&shy;stem&shy;ology*.

### 2. Build rapport

* Find a friendly tone & maintain it.
* Show that you are inter&shy;ested & listening.
* Share what You have in common.
* Show curiosity.
* Don't offer facts unless asked.

#### Patience & practice

Keeping a conversation frien&shy;dly is *critical* for success.

\
*Be patient* – It's fine to build rapport over several chats before proceeding with the hardest topics.

\
*Stay cool* – Avoiding *topic rebuttal* is hard, and often requires practice.

\
*Need help?* – [Practice SE with strangers](#/8/1).

### 3. Find & confirm a claim

* ✅ Claim is positive, e.g. *«this exists / is true»*
* ✅ … Specific & clear.
* ✅ … Foundational or im&shy;portant to the topic
* ❌ … Trivial or obvious
* Ask if they want to explore it with you
* ⚠️  Stop if the claim is a *safety net*!


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

#### Not all claims

In this context, a *safety net* is something
that pre&shy;vents an individual from doing harm
to them&shy;selves or others.

\
*«My God helped me be&shy;come sober, and without Him I would probably drink myself to death.»*

\
Sometimes SE just isn't the right tool for the situation.

### 4. Clarify terms

* *«What do you mean when you say this?»*
* In your own words, repeat what you hear.
* Ask if you understand correctly.
* Identify & clarify words that may confuse.


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")


#### Politeness & clarity

Use *their* de&shy;fini&shy;tions when pos&shy;sible, and if it's not confusing.

\
If it's dif&shy;ficult to *pin down* a term, use quali&shy;fied terms.

\
Adopting a *learner's per&shy;spec&shy;tive* may help.

### 5. Assess & cali&shy;brate confidence

* *«How confident are you this claim is true?»* 0–100%
* *«What would move you up just a bit?»*
* *«What would move you down?»*
* *«What could change your mind?»*


[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

* At 100%, *«Would any&shy;thing increase your con&shy;fidence even higher?»*
* *«How would physical evidence change your con&shy;fidence?»*
* At 0%, *«What reasons do you think others have for being higher?»*
* Above 0%, *«Why not lower?»*
* Below 100%, *«Why not higher?»*


[comment]: # (|||)

* *«If this reason was un&shy;avail&shy;able to you, would it change your confidence?»*
* *«... and if not, what other rea&shy;son is keeping you at your level of confidence?»*


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 6. Explore reasons & reliability

* What reasons did they use to arrive at their belief?
* Assess the quality of these reasons.
* What ways can we use to determine a reason is sound?
* If our methods are unreliable, would the assessment change?

[comment]: # (||| data-background-size="50%" data-background-image="dist/media/street-epistemology-logo.png", data-background-position="100% 0%" data-background-opacity="0.2")

*This is the key goal of Street&nbsp;Epistemology*.

<br>

* Explore the reliability of any methods used when forming a belief.
* *How* questions are the goal, after *Why* and *What*.
* Embrace their pauses.
* *«Let's go through the steps together.»*
* *«How can we be con&shy;fident if our methods aren't reliable?»*

#### Recognizing bad reasons

* ❌ [Informal fallacies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Informal_fallacies), like *Appeal to au&shy;th&shy;ority*, *Ap&shy;peal to ig&shy;no&shy;rance* or *Ap&shy;peal to tradition*.
* ❌ [Cognitive biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias#List_of_biases), like *Con&shy;fir&shy;mation bias* and *Avail&shy;ability heu&shy;ris&shy;tic* and *Moti&shy;vated reasoning*.
* ❌ Uses sources that don't pass [the C.R.A.A.P. test](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAAP_test).

\
*«If a website only writes things I agree with, how can I know if it's truthful?»*

### 7. Summarize & pause to think

* Try to end with *aporia* and wonder.
* Success is when all are happy to have had the conversation.
* If you can, offer to con&shy;tinue the chat later.
* Give them a printed [Introducing.SE card](dist/media/introducing-se-card-2021-01.pdf).

Some conversations may re&shy;quire several sessions.

\
End your sessions with some&shy;thing they can wonder about!

\
*«That was a good question. You're making me think!»*
