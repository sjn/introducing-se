### What is Street Epistemology?

* A community of people who practice SE in a friendly setting

### 1. Set your goals

* Do you want to learn, teach or empathize?
* Are you open to changing your own mind?
* Don’t use clever questions to “trap”
* Be honest upfront
* [Share](#/8) the process & this page

### 2. Build rapport

* Find a friendly tone & maintain it
* Show that you are interested & listening
* Share what you have in common
* Show curiosity
* Don't offer facts unless asked

### 3. Find & confirm a claim

* ✅ Claims that are specific & clear
* ✅ Claims that are foundational
* ❌ Is the claim «obvious»?
* Ask if they want to explore it with you
* ⚠️  Stop if the claim is a «safety net»!


[comment]: # (|||)

A «safty net» is something that prevents
an individual from doing harm to themselves
or others – e.g. *«Jesus helped me become
sober, and without him I'd proably die»*

### 4. Clarify terms

* «What do you mean when you say X?»
* In your own words, repeat what you hear
* Ask if you understand correctly
* Identify & clarify words that may confuse


[comment]: # (!!!)

### 5. ID confidence

* «How confident are you your claim is true?» 0–100%
* «What would move you up just a %?»
* «What would move you down?»
* «What could change your mind?»

### 6. Explore reasons & reliability

* What reasons did they use to arrive at their belief?
* Assess the quality of these reasons
* What ways can we use to determine a reason is sound?
* If our methods are unreliable, would the assessment change?

[comment]: # (|||)

* The key goal is to explore the reliability of the methods we use when forming a belief.
* «I learned this on a website I like»
* «I like this website because they write things I agree with»

\
– *If a website only writes things you agree with, how do you know
it always is truthful?*

### 7. [Summarize & pause to think](#)

* Try to end with aporia — wonder
* Success: When all are happy to have had the conversation
* If you can, offer to continue the chat later
* Give them a printed [Introducing.SE card](dist/media/introducing-se-card-2021-01.pdf)
