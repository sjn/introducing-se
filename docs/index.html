### 2. Pick a claim &&nbsp;clarify

* Find a [claim to explore](#/2/1).
* What is [a good claim?](#/2/2).
* Turn [normative claims](#/2/3) factual.
* [Clarify](#/2/4) terms.
* Avoid [«Safety Net»](#/2/5) claims.

Note:
* Find a claim
    * **Single, factual**
    * **Specific, important, positive**
* Normative caims
    * **Ask "whys" to turn into factual claim**
* Clarify terms
    * "True for me", qualify, use **their definition**, take notes
* Safety Net
    * "If it was not for my belief, I would drink myself to death"


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Find a claim to explore

* *«Do you have a topic you want to explore?»*
* *«… you wish more people knew of?»*
* *«… or agreed with?»*
* Aim for a [**single topic**](#/2/2).
* Re-phrase the topic as [a factual claim](#/2/3).
* *«Would you mind if we explore this together?»*

\
*Don't rush when considering claims!*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### What is a good claim?

* ✅ Claim is specific, clear & terse.
* ✅ …Foundational or im&shy;portant for them.
* ✅ …A positive phrase: *«I believe …»*
* ❌ Not a negative phrase: ~~*«I don't believe …»*~~
* ⚠️  …Trivial or obvious.

\
⚠️  Stop if the claim is part of a [Safety Net](#/2/4)!


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Normative vs. factual

*«Normative should;<br> Factual is.»*

<br>

* «Is» claims are often ea&shy;sier to explore.
* «Should» claims often re&shy;quire extra work.
* Sometimes, asking «why» helps you find a fac&shy;tual claim to explore!

\
*«If everyone ag&shy;reed with the [norma&shy;tive claim], what would change in the world?»*

\
*«…[how confident](#/3) are you this change would happen?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Clarifying terms

*«True»* vs. *«True for me»* vs. *«True for all.»*

<br>

* *«What do you mean when you say …?»*
* In *your own* words, **repeat** what you hear.
* Have them **confirm** if you under&shy;stand correctly.
* Identify, clarify & qualify confusing words.
* Use *their* de&shy;fini&shy;tions.

\
*Take notes!*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### ⚠️  Avoid «Safety Net» claims

A *Safety Net* is a belief that pre&shy;vents an individual from doing harm to them&shy;selves or others.

\
*«My Belief helped me be&shy;come sober, and without it I would probably drink myself to death.»*

\
SE is not always the right tool to use, and **SE is not for therapy**. Please do no harm!

### 3. Ask for con&shy;fi&shy;dence on a scale &&nbsp;calibrate

* Ask for [confidence](#/3/1).
* [Explore](#/3/2) their confidence.
* [Pre-contemplative](#/3/3) or&nbsp;not?
* [Nudging](#/3/4) confidence.

Note:
* Ask for confidence
    * Avoids polarization, **use a scale**, ask for up, down, what would change mind
* Explore confidence
    * &gt;100%, evidence, why not other arguments? **why not extremes**?
* OPTONAL: Pre-contemplative?
    * 0 or 100? trust? tribe?
* OPTIONAL: Nudging confidence
    * If room for &gt;100%, calibrate? postpone? evidence important? community important?


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Ask for confidence

*Use a scale to help reduce polarization.*

<br>

* *«How **confident** are you X is true?»* 0–100%
* *«How important is it for you to believe in true things?»* 0–100%
* *«Why is this the right number for you?»*
* *«What would move you up just a bit?»*
* *«What would move you down a little?»*
* *«What could change your mind?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Explore their confidence

* At 100%, *«Would any&shy;thing increase your con&shy;fidence even higher?»*
* *«How would physical evidence change your con&shy;fidence?»*
* At 0%, *«What reasons do you think others have for being higher?»*
* Above 0%, *«Why not lower?»*
* Below 100%, *«Why not higher?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Pre-contemplative —&nbsp;or&nbsp;not?

*«I am 100% confident, and nothing can change my mind»*

<br>

* 100% or 0% con&shy;fidence may indicate they are pre-con&shy;tem&shy;pla&shy;tive.
* Build trust by exploring a «softer» topic first?
* Is their confidence a shib&shy;boleth of their tribe?

\
*«Is there anything you can think of, or learn, that would lower your confidence?»*

\
*«Under what conditions would this claim be false?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Nudging confidence

\
*«Can you imagine some&shy;thing that would make you even more confident?»*

\
*«If there is still room to be&shy;come more con&shy;fi&shy;dent, what would you re&shy;cali&shy;brate your cur&shy;rent con&shy;fi&shy;dence to?»*

\
*«If you value evidence, what evidence would change your mind?»*

\
*«If your community changed their mind, would you also?»*

### 4. Identify main reason

* What is [their most im&shy;portant source](#/4/1), ex&shy;peri&shy;ence or reason?
* Are there any other [under&shy;lying reasons](#/4/2) sup&shy;porting this?
* [Many small reasons](#/4/3), or a few large?

* What is **their most im&shy;portant source**, ex&shy;peri&shy;ence or reason?
* Are there any other **under&shy;lying reasons** sup&shy;porting this?
* **Many small reasons**, or a few large?
* If underlying reason is unavailable, confidence change, yes: how? no: what else? switch topic?
* Many small/few large: commonalities, influence how, adds/multiplies, take notes


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Asking about reasons

*«What makes this particular reason a good one for you?»*

\
*«If you could learn of a better reason to support this belief, what would it look like?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Exploring underlying reasons

<br>

* *«If this reason was un&shy;avail&shy;able to you, would it change your con&shy;fi&shy;dence?»*
* *«…if so, how would it change?»*
* *«…and if not, **what else** is keeping you at your con&shy;fi&shy;dence level?»*
* [Switching topic](#/2) or focu&shy;sing on [another reason](#/4) is fine!

\
*«Claim 2 seems to be important for your belief in claim 1. Would you mind if we explore it instead?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Many small, or a&nbsp;few&nbsp;large?

*Explore to under&shy;stand their back&shy;ground.*

<br>

* Are there any com&shy;mon&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ties between the reasons?
* With many small, ask how each in&shy;flu&shy;en&shy;ces their confidence.
* Is this influence ad&shy;ditive (may surpass 100%) or mul&shy;tipli&shy;ca&shy;tive (may never reach 100%)?

\
*Take notes!*

\
*When you're done, restate & sum&shy;marize their reason(s).*

### 5. Explore & assess epistemology & reliablility

*Is our epistemology reliable? Let's assess.*

<br>

* This is [the key goal of&nbsp;SE](#/5/1).
* [Explore epistemology](#/5/2).
* [Assess reliability](#/5/3).
* [Recognize unreliable reasons](#/5/5).

Note:
* The key goal
    * **reliability**, **how** &gt; why &gt; what
* Epistemology
    * **arrive**, rule out, soundness
* Reliability
    * **Outsider test**, consultant, double standard
    * Conformity, status quo, selective skeptic
* Fallacies
    * Appeal to authority, ignorance, tradition
* Biases
    * Confirmation bias, availability heuristic, motivated reasoning
* News
    * bias, misleading, fact check fails, naïve realism
* Publications
    * C.R.A.A.P test


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### The key goal of SE

*Explore the reliability of methods used when forming a belief.*

\
***How*** questions are bet&shy;ter than *Why* & *What.*

\
*«If our methods aren't reliable, how can we be confident?»*

</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Exploring Epistemology

* *«How did you arrive at the reason?»*
* *«How did you rule out other reasons that could explain the same?»*
* *«What methods were used to determine the [sound&shy;ness](https://iep.utm.edu/val-snd/) of this reason?»*
* *«How can we de&shy;termine if these methods are reliable?»*

\
*«If a method or a reason is un&shy;reli&shy;able, how does this affect our as&shy;sess&shy;ment?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Exploring reliability I

**The outsider test**<br>
–&nbsp;*«Would some&shy;one using your rea&shy;sons, but coming from a different starting point reach the same conclusion?»*

**The consultant test**<br>
–&nbsp;*«How would you evaluate this claim if it was **not** your own?»*

**The double standard test**<br>
–&nbsp;*«Am I judging other pe&shy;ople’s reasoning by a stan&shy;dard I wouldn’t apply to myself?»*

\
([continued…](#/5/4))

</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Exploring reliability II

**The conformity test**<br>
–&nbsp;*«If other people no longer held this belief, to what extent would you still hold it?»*

**The status quo bias test**<br>
–&nbsp;*«If your current claim was not the status quo, would you still actively choose it?»*

**The selective skeptic test**<br>
–&nbsp;*«If the same reasoning sup&shy;ported a dif&shy;ferent or op&shy;posing conclusion, how cre&shy;dible would you judge it to be?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

#### Recognizing unreliable reasons

* ❌ [Informal fallacies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Informal_fallacies), like *[Appeals to auth&shy;ority](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority)*, *[ig&shy;no&shy;rance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance)* or *[tradition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition).*
* ❌ [Cognitive biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias#List_of_biases), like *[Con&shy;fir&shy;mation bias](https://yourbias.is/confirmation-bias)*, *[Av&shy;ail&shy;abi&shy;lity heu&shy;ris&shy;tic](https://yourbias.is/the-availability-heuristic)* and *[Moti&shy;vated reasoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning).*
* ❌ News sources are [biased or misleading](https://adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart/).
* ❌ News sources that [fail fact checks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/).
* ❌ Academic publi&shy;ca&shy;tions that don't pass [the C.R.A.A.P. test](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAAP_test).

#### Some talks are *hard*

Imagine a topic – *poli&shy;tical*, *ideo&shy;logi&shy;cal*, *ethi&shy;cal* or maybe even *con&shy;fusing*, *con&shy;tent&shy;ious* or *harmful*.

\
Do you offer critique? Facts? De&shy;ri&shy;sion? A pas&shy;sio&shy;nate plea to change their mind? Or do you just avoid it all, distancing yourself?

\
If you have to engage, you can do it in an effective and respectful way, with [Street&nbsp;Epistemology](#/0/2).
