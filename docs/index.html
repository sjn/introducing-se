### 2. Pick a claim &&nbsp;clarify

* Find a [claim to explore](#/2/1).
* [Clarify](#/2/2) terms.
* Ask «why» questions to turn [normative claims](#/2/3) factual.
* Avoid [«Safety Nets»](#/2/4).

    * **Single, factual**
    * **Specific, important, positive**
* Clarify terms
    * "True for me", qualify, use **their definition**, take notes
* Normative caims
    * **Ask "whys" to turn into factual claim**
* Safety Nets
    * "If it was not for my belief, I would drink myself to death"


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Find a claim to explore

* *«Do you have a topic you want to explore?»*
* *«…you wish more people knew of?»*
* *«…or agreed with?»*
* Aim for a [**single topic**](#/2/5).
* Re-phrase the topic as [a factual claim](#/2/3).
* Don't rush when considering claims!

\
⚠️  Stop if the claim is part of a [Safety Net](#/2/4)!

</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>

</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Normative vs. factual

*Normative ought;<br> Factual is.*

<br>

* «Is» claims are often ea&shy;sier to explore.
* «Ought» claims often re&shy;quire extra clari&shy;fication.
* Asking «why» can help you get closer to a fac&shy;tual claim to explore!

\
*«If everyone ag&shy;reed with the [norma&shy;tive claim], what would change in the world?»*

\
*«…[How confident](#/3) are you this change would happen?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### ⚠️  Avoid «Safety Net» claims

A *Safety Net* is a belief that pre&shy;vents an individual from doing harm to them&shy;selves or others.

\
*«My Belief helped me be&shy;come sober, and without it I would probably drink myself to death.»*

\
SE is not always the right tool to use, and **SE is not for therapy**. Please do no harm. Pick another claim!


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### What is a good claim?

* ✅ Claim is specific, clear &amp; terse.
* ✅ …Phrased as a positive: *«I believe…»*
* ✅ …Relevant to us both: *«True for us»*

* Use a scale, to help further exploration.
* [Explore](#/3/2) their confidence.
* Respectfully [challenge](#/3/3) their confidence.
* Extra: Are they [pre-con&shy;templative](#/3/4)?

\
*«How __confident__ are you this is&nbsp;true?»*

Note:
* Ask for confidence
    * Avoids polarization, **use a scale**, ask for up, down, what would change mind
    * how important is it to **believe in true things**?
* Explore confidence
    * Evidence, why not other arguments? **why not extremes**?
* OPTONAL: Pre-contemplative?
    * 0 or 100? trust? tribe?
    * If room for &gt;100%, calibrate? postpone? is evidence important?


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Ask for confidence

*Use a scale to help reduce polarization.*

<br>

* *«How **confident** are you X is true?»* 0–100%
* *«How important is it for you to believe in true things?»* 0–100%
* *«Why is this the right number for you?»*
* *«What would move you up just a bit?»*
* *«What would move you down a little?»*
* *«What could change your mind?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Explore their confidence

* At 100%, *«Would any&shy;thing increase your con&shy;fidence even higher?»*
* *«How would physical evidence change your con&shy;fidence?»*
* At 0%, *«What reasons do you think others have for being higher?»*
* Above 0%, *«Why not lower?»*
* Below 100%, *«Why not higher?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Respectfully challenge their confidence

*«Can you imagine some&shy;thing that would make you even more confident?»*

\
*«If there is still room to be&shy;come more con&shy;fi&shy;dent, what would you re&shy;cali&shy;brate your cur&shy;rent con&shy;fi&shy;dence to?»*

\
*«If you value evidence, what evidence would change your mind?»*

\
*«If your community or tribe changed their mind, would you also?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Pre-contemplative —&nbsp;or&nbsp;not?

*«I am 100% confident, and nothing can change my mind»*

<br>

* 100% or 0% con&shy;fidence may indicate they are pre-con&shy;tem&shy;pla&shy;tive.
* Build trust by exploring a topic with «shades of grey» first?
* Is their confidence a shib&shy;boleth (signal of mem&shy;ber&shy;ship) of their tribe?

\
*«Is there anything you can think of, or learn, that would lower your confidence?»*

\
*«Under what conditions could this claim be false?»*

### 4. Identify main reason

* What is [their most im&shy;por&shy;tant source](#/4/1), ex&shy;peri&shy;ence or reason for their confidence?
* Are there any other [under&shy;lying reasons](#/4/2) sup&shy;porting this?
* [Many small reasons](#/4/3), or a few large?

\
*«__Why__ do you believe this, and what makes you this confident?»*


Note:
* Asking for source/reason
    * **What makes it good?** better reason?
* Underlying reasons
    * What if reason is unavailable, confidence change, yes: how? no: what else? switch topic?
* Many small/few large reasons
    * Commonalities? influence how – adds/multiplies? take notes!


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Asking about reasons

*«How did you arrive at this conclusion?»*

\
*«What makes this particular reason a good one for you?»*

\
*«If you could learn of a better reason to support this belief, what would it look like?»*

\
*«How do you figure out if a reason is a good one?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Exploring underlying reasons

* *«If this reason was un&shy;avail&shy;able to you, would it change your con&shy;fi&shy;dence?»*
* *«…if so, how would it change?»*
* *«…and if not, **what else** is keeping you at your con&shy;fi&shy;dence level?»*
* [Switching topic](#/2) or focu&shy;sing on a [more important reason](#/4) is fine!

\
*«Claim 2 seems to be important for your confidence in claim 1. Would you mind if we explore it instead?»*


</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


#### Many small, or a&nbsp;few&nbsp;large?

*Explore to under&shy;stand their back&shy;ground.*

<br>

* Are there any com&shy;mon&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ties between the reasons?
* With many small, ask how each in&shy;flu&shy;en&shy;ces their confidence.
* Does this influence add (and may surpass 100%) or mul&shy;tiply (and never reach 100%)?

\
*Take notes!*

\
*When you're done, restate &amp; sum&shy;marize their reason(s).*

\

\
([continued…](#/5/4))
