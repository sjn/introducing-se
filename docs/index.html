# How to explore ideas & beliefs

1. Check your intentions
2. Build rapport
3. Find & confirm their claim
4. Clarify terms
5. ID Confidence
6. Explore reasons & reliability
7. Summarize & pause to think



# 1. Check your intentions

* Do you want to learn or to teach?
* Are you open to change your own mind?
* Don’t make clever question “traps”
* Be honest upfront!
* Share the process & this page!


# 2. Build rapport

* Find a good tone, and tend it!
* Show that you are listening.
* Ask for clarification
* Repeat what you hear
* Share what you have in common.
* Show curiosity!



# 3. Find & confirm their claim

* Good: Claims that are specific & clear
* Good: Claims that are foundational
* Bad: Does “everyone” agree?
* Ask if they want to explore with you!
* Skip if the claim is a “safety net”!


# 4. Clarify terms

* “What do you mean when you say X?”
* Repeat in your own words what you heard & ask if you understood it
* Identify & clarify words that are used in multiple ways



# 5. ID confidence

* “How confident are you that your claim is true?” 0% – 100%
* “What would move you up 1%?”
* “What would move you down?”
* What could change their mind?


# 6. Explore reasons & reliability

* If they learn their source is unreliable – would it change anything?
* What else is propping up their belief?


# 7. Summarize & pause to think

* Try to end with aporia – wonder
* Success is when everyone is happy to have had the conversation
* If you can, offer to continue the chat later
